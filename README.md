# Call Center Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing call center performance metrics to assess customer interactions and overall efficiency. The dataset provides detailed information on key indicators such as call volume, average handling time (AHT), and customer satisfaction scores. The goal is to uncover insights that can be used to improve operational processes and enhance customer experience.

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to:

- Measure and evaluate the performance of the call center.
- Identify trends in customer interactions and service levels.
- Provide actionable insights to improve call handling efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Python**: Used for additional data manipulation.

## Key Metrics Analyzed
1. **Average Handling Time (AHT)**: Time taken to handle customer queries.
2. **Call Volume**: Number of calls received over a given period.
3. **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**: Ratings provided by customers post-interaction.
4. **Call Abandonment Rate**: Percentage of calls that were disconnected before reaching an agent.

## Insights & Recommendations
- Identified peak hours with high call volume to allocate resources more effectively.
- Found correlation between AHT and CSAT, suggesting that faster resolutions lead to higher satisfaction.
- Recommended improving call routing strategies to reduce call abandonment rates.

## Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes the following:
- **Call volume trends over time**.
- **Comparison of AHT against CSAT scores**.
- **Customer satisfaction distribution**.
- **Abandonment rate analysis by time of day**.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Satyam18g/call-center-analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the Power BI file to explore the interactive dashboard or run the Python scripts for data analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding sentiment analysis for recorded customer feedback.
- Integrating predictive analytics to forecast peak call volumes.
